This folder is called `docs` because it should be hosted on Github Pages. It does not contain any documentation. For user documentation, see the [`README`](../README.md), there is no more functionality than described there.

This folder is mostly a copy from the [TexLive.js example on Github Pages](https://github.com/manuels/texlive.js/tree/gh-pages). See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for detailed information.
