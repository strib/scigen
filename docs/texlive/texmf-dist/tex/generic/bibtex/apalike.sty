% History:
% 16-Sep-86, original version by Oren Patashnik, ideas from Susan King.
% 13-Oct-87 changes:
%       Fixed bug in last line by adding the {} that disappeard when
%               the \hbox{} was removed from the pre-APALIKE definition;
%       added club and widow penalties;
%       patched the \newblock LaTeX bug from `-.07em' to simply `.07em';
%       and made this work for document styles that don't define `chapter'.
% Undated changes by Karl Berry and/or Oren Patashnik:
%       1) use \refname and \bibname instead of hardwiring
%          the strings "References" and "Bibliography"; this change was first
%          made in the apalike.sty in the germbib package.
%       2) do not define \bibhang if it is already defined.
%       Karl Berry contributes his changes to the public domain.
% 8-Dec-10, clarify license.

% Use parens instead of brackets for \cite, and no label in the bibliography
