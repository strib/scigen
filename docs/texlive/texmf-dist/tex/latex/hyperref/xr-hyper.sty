%% xr package (beta release)

%% Copyright (C) 1993-1997 David Carlisle

%% This is a modified version of the xr package from the Standard LaTeX
%% tools distribution. It has some internal changes to cooperate with
%% the hyperref package, and one new user level argument, also mainly of
%% use for hyperref.
%% If no problems are reported the version in the tools distribution
%% will be updated to match this at the next LaTeX release.

%% \externaldocument[prefix]{document}[URL]

%% The `document' referred to by the main argument is the file
%% document.aux
%% which must be somewhere on TeX's input path.
%% Some packages (eg hyperref) really need to know the location of the
%% final document rather than the aux file. By default this is assumed
%% to be `document.dvi'. A package may redefine the command \XR@ext to
%% change this default extension (eg some of the hyperref backends
%% define this to be `document.pdf'). However sometimes the final
%% document may be in a position unrelated to the aux file, or the
%% browser may not be able to find files at an arbitrary point in
%% TeX's input path, so the new final optional argument allows a full
%% URL to the final document to be specified.
%%
%% \externaldocument{file}[http://here.xxx.edu/this/path/to/file.dvi]
%%
%% Unless a package redefines \XR@addfile, the optional URL argument
%% will be ignored.
%%
%% This version (beta2) also has another improvement unrelated
%% to the hyperref support. Olivier Michel pointed out that
%% if the aux file was not on texinputs you could not always go
%% \externaldocument{/some/path/to/file}
%% specifically that worked if file.aux was a `simple'  document with
%% one aux file, but if \include had been used, the `sub' aux files
%% would not be found by xr in the remote directory.
%% This version calls \filename@parse to get the directory name of the
%% remote directory, which is then explicitly prepended to the names of
%% any included aux files.
