% Manuel Pégourié-Gonnard, originally written 2010. WTFPL v2.

% To be loaded after latex.ltx and before luatex-unicode-letters.tex.

% latex.ltx (ltfinal.dtx) sets lccodes, uccodes, sfcodes and catcodes for
% characters in the "00-"ff range.
%
% In the "80-"ff range, lccodes, uccodes & sfcodes are based on T1, and need
% to be reset before the correct, Unicode-based, codes are set. Also, the
% catcodes are set to 12 (other).

% A few codes in the ASCII range are set by latex.ltx:
%
% \lccode`\^^[=`\^^[ % oe in OT1
% \lccode`\- =`\-    % default hyphen char
% \lccode 127=127    % alternate hyphen char
% \lccode 23 =23     % textcompwordmark in T1
%
% They don't look too problematic, so we don't reset them now, but this may
% change later if problems are found.
