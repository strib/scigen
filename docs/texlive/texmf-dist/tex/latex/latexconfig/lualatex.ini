% JAW: Enable 'extra' pdfTeX primitives only in .ini file
% latex.ltx enables the extra primitives bu a subset of those from
% pdfTeX are needed to do the configuration below (pdftexconfig.tex).
% Rather than list them all, just enable those classed as 'pdftex'.
    \directlua{tex.enableprimitives('',tex.extraprimitives('pdftex'))}
% JAW: Set up job name quoting before latex.ltx
% Web2c pdfTeX/XeTeX quote job names containing spaces, but LuaTeX does
% not do this at the engine level. The behaviour can be changed using
% a callback. Originally this code was loaded via lualatexquotejobname.tex
% but that required a hack around latex.ltx: the behaviour has been altered
% to allow the callback route to be used directly.
  \global\everyjob{\directlua{require("lualatexquotejobname.lua")}}
