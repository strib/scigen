%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%
%%% Use this file to make a format based on the preamble of any LaTeX
%%% file
%%%
%%% There are no restrictions on the distribution or modification of
%%% this file, except that other people should not attempt to alter
%%% the master copy on the ctan archives.
%%%
%%% Making the format
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%
%%% Given a LaTeX file `abc.tex', use initex as follows:
%%%
%%% initex &latex  mylatex.ltx abc      (Generic TeX)
%%% initex \&latex mylatex.ltx abc      (unix and other TeX's)
%%% tex /i &latex  mylatex.ltx abc      (emtex)
%%%
%%% If you are on a Mac or using some shell that makes it inconvenient
%%% to use a command line such as the above examples then you may
%%% make a file `mylatex.tex' with the single line
%%% \input mylatex.ltx abc
%%% and then pass the file mylatex.tex to your (ini)tex shell to produce
%%% the format, ie something equivalent to initex &latex mylatex.tex.
%%%
%%% If you are using OzTeX, see the separate instructions below.
%%%
%%% This should make a format file mylatex.fmt which you can then use
%%% as follows
%%%
%%% Using the new format
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%
%%% tex  &mylatex abc          (generic TeX)
%%% virtex \&mylatex abc       (Unix TeX)
%%%
%%% This will process your document, abc.tex, just as LaTeX does, but
%%% quicker as the contents of the preamble will be stored in the
%%% format file and will not need to be run each time.
%%%
%%% If (vir)tex fails to find your mylatex.fmt then it is not searching
%%% in the current directory, either modify your TEXFORMATS path (or
%%% equivalent) to search `.' or (on unix/dos) use   ./  as in:
%%% virtex \&./mylatex abc
%%%
%%% Making and using the format with OzTeX
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% 
%%% Given a LaTeX file `abc.tex', do this: select `TeX...' from OzTeX's 
%%% TeX menu, and go to the folder containing the file `abc.tex' as if you 
%%% were selecting the file `abc.tex'. Then hit the Cancel button - this 
%%% procedure sets OzTeX's working folder to the one containing abc.tex. 
%%% Next, select iniTeX from the TeX menu, and type:
%%% 
%%% &latex mylatex.ltx abc
%%% 
%%% This should make a format file mylatex.fmt which you can save in the 
%%% same folder as the file you're working on.
%%% 
%%% To use the new format, put this at the very start of the very first 
%%% line of your document:
%%% 
%%% %&mylatex
%%%
%%% Further Notes
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%
%%% The file abc.tex must contain a line *just* with
%%% \begin{document}
%%% Everything up to (but not including) the \begin{document} will
%%% be saved in the format and not executed in subsequent runs.
%%%
%%% If you are modifying the document (or working on a similar document)
%%% you may wish to add new commands to your document preamble.
%%% The `mylatex' format normally skips the whole preamble (believing
%%% it to be pre-loaded) and so such new commands do not take effect.
%%% You could re-make the format, preloading the new preamble, but that
%%% might be inconvenient to do every time, and so an alternative scheme
%%% has been introduced.
%%% If the preamble contains a comment   mylatex  (ie a line just
%%% containing a % white space and the word mylatex) then the mylatex
%%% format will start reading the preable at that point so any new
%%% commands can be placed after such a comment and they will be
%%% executed.

%%%  Modified 1996/01/26 To fix printout of preloaded files (which

%%%            incompatibility with \makeindex command.
%%%  Modified 1997/10/04 To generalise the \makeindex support to work
%%%            with any (well most:-) \openout uses in the preamble.
%%%  Modified 1997/10/09 Most? Ross Moore pointed out I just broke
%%%            changebar, so further tinkering. Also useful discussions
%%%            with Ross lead to the following changes.
%%%            Added `mylatex' comment feature.
%%%            Added some font preloading.
%%%  Modified 1998/01/21 Jean-Francois Mertens pointed out that comments
%%%            before the first TeX command were broken by the previous
%%%            version. In particular %&mylatex special comments which
