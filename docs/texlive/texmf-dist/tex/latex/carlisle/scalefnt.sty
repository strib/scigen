% This package defines a command \scalefont. After \scalefont{.75} then
% the current font and baselineskip will be scaled to 75% of their
% original size. Any scale factor may be specified.

% If you are using traditional fd files based on bitmap font sizes,
% LaTeX's font system will round the requested font size to the nearest
% available size. If you are using scalable fonts, such as the psnfss
% or type1cm packages, then the requested font size will be used exactly.

% Almost all of the code here is in fact dealing with scaling the stretch
% components of \baselineskip. This is a bit odd as 99% of documents
% have a rigid \baselineskip, however the technique may be useful in
% some contexts, and is left here as an example.
