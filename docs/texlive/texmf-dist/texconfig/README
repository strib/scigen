Thomas Esser, 1999. Public domain.

I hereby put this README file and the files g/generic, v/vt100 and
x/xterm into the public donain.

The files contained in the subdirectories are provided, because
texconfig havily relies on a properly installed terminfo system.

Some systems have buggy or touble-causing terminfo files and/or
a buggy curses library. Therefore, the dialog program provided
by me is linked against the ncurses library and uses its own
terminfo files.

Set the variable

	DIALOG_TERMINFO to specify an alternate terminfo directory
		(e.g. /usr/lib/terminfo)

	DIALOG_TERM to use an alternate configuration file (e.g. xterm)

before starting texconfig.

texconfig sets DIALOG_TERM to generic by default.
