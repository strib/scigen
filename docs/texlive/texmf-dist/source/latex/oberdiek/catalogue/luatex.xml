  <description>
    LuaTeX is an extended version of pdfTeX using Lua as an embedded
    scripting language.  The LuaTeX project&#x2019;s main objective
    is to provide an open and configurable variant of TeX while at the
    same time offering downward compatibility.
    <p/>
    LuaTeX uses Unicode (as UTF-8) as its default input encoding, and
    is able to use modern (OpenType) fonts (for both text and mathematics).
    <p/>
    It should be noted that LuaTeX is still under development; its
    specification has been declared stable, but absolute stability
    may not in practice be assumed.
    <p/>
    The package is part of the <xref refid='oberdiek'>oberdiek</xref> bundle.
