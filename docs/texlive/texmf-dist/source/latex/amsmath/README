========================================================================
I. OVERVIEW

The amsmath package is an extension package for LaTeX that provides
additional features to facilitate mathematical typesetting. It has been
developed by the American Mathematical Society and released for general
use as a service to the mathematical community. A number of smaller
auxiliary packages are also distributed with the amsmath package.

========================================================================
II. INSTALLATION AND GETTING STARTED

In order to use amsmath you need to have TeX installed first. TeX is
not an AMS product. For information on getting TeX see one of the
following:

    http://www.tug.org/
    http://www.ams.org/tex/tex-resources

If you are installing amsmath manually, see install.txt.

The primary documentation for amsmath is in

    amsldoc.pdf

Additional documentation files include:

    diffs-m.txt
    subeqn.pdf
    technote.pdf
    testmath.pdf

which are included in the collection.

========================================================================
III. SUBMITTING BUG REPORTS

Technical support is available via the addresses listed above.  Bug
reports should be submitted using the standard LaTeX bug reporting
system: Execute the command

    latex latexbug.tex

and follow the resulting instructions. Select "amslatex" when asked
for a category.

========================================================================
IV. REMARKS ON THIS RELEASE

Version 2.14 is a minor update to provide more fluid interoperability
with stix.sty.  It should be fully compatible with version 2.13.

========================================================================
V. CHANGE LOG (REVERSE CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER)

2013-01-14 amsmath.dtx 2.14

    * amsmath.sty 2.14
      -- Minimal changes to make amsmath compatible with stix.sty.

2000-07-18 amsmath.dtx 2.13
    -- After the numbering patches in 2.11, \notag failed in certain
       circumstances: introduce some more auxiliary functions to sort
       things out, and redefine \nonumber.

2000-06-29 amstext.dtx 2.01
    -- Use \f@size instead of \tf@size because they are not
       necessarily the same and the former is better for putting a few
       words into a display.

2000-06-06 amsmath.dtx 2.12
    -- Fix transposed lines in 2.11 patch.

2000-06-02 amsmath.dtx 2.11

    * amsmath.sty 2.11
      -- Prevent "Arithmetic overflow" error by guarding against
         divide-by-zero in \x@calc@shift@lc (align environment).

    * amsdtx.dtx
      -- Moved to the amscls distribution.

2000-05-25 amsmath.dtx 2.10
    -- Clear up error message for \allowdisplaybreaks[0].
    -- Make mathdisplay re-entrant by introducing mathdisplay@stack,
       to clear up numbering problems in unusual circumstances such as
       \[ \] nested inside minipage inside equation.

2000-04-21 amsmath.dtx 2.09
    -- Ensure good catcodes for " etc.

2000-03-16 amsmath.dtx 2.08
    -- Fixed erroneous tag placement on split with fleqn/tbtags options.

2000-03-15 amsmath.dtx 2.07
    -- Add \reset@strutbox@ to deal with the following bug: After
       $...\mbox{\Huge $...$}...$, line spacing is wrong in a
       following "gather" or other environment that uses \strut@.
    -- Patch to fix bug with intlimits option: too much space in the
       middle of \iint.
    -- Overhaul math accents again to fix a couple of bugs reported by
       Thimm.

2000-03-10 amsmath.dtx 2.06
    -- Change \MathAccent to \mathaccentV so \DeclareMathAccent won't
       give an error when redefining an accent.

2000-01-06 amsmath.dtx 2.05
    -- Fixed incorrect placement of fleqn/reqno equation numbers
       inside indented lists (displaywidth < columnwidth). Changed the
       multline/fleqn/leqno indent to match mathmargin when possible
       instead of always just using multlinetaggap.
