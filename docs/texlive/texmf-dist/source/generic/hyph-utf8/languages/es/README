DIVISI'ON DE PALABRAS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The file eshyph.tex under /base is the base for the Spanish patters.
It is intended mainly for backward compatibility.  New systems are
best based on CTAN:language/hyph-utf8/, which has the same patterns.

Why 4.x? Well, I know at least other three files with the same name,
so this one is the fourth (there were at least 6 or 7 patterns files).
The others should vanish as soon as posible.

- division.pdf is a draft of an article (in Spanish) explaining the
rules to be applied and how they are being translated into TeX in a
unified set of patterns (somewhat outdated).
- eshyph-make.lua generates the patterns, with eshyph.src for prefixes
and special cases.
- eshyph-test.tex makes a comparison with strict syllabic rules.  It
requires a file spanish-words.txt (not supplied) with a list of word,
one per line.  You can (should) filter the words.

I would like to thanks Francesc Carmona for his permission
to steal parts of his work without restrictions. 

The contrib directory, as its name implies, is not part of the
official bundle. It has a different set of patterns, but it does not
follow the rules by the Spanish Academy (despite its claims).

What's new in 4.5 (2009-08-01)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Missing group -gl- added (a major bug). A few minor improvements
for "des-" and "in-".

What's new in 4.4 (2009-05-19)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some bad patterns fixed.

What's new in 4.3 (2009-05-14)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some patterns fixed, particularly for "familia", "superar", "sub-" and
final consonants.  Patterns are now generated with the help of a few
lua/luatex files (whose status is alpha).

What's new in 4.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The encoding is UTF-8, so that it can be used with LuaTeX. Yet, it
works without changes with standard TeX.

What's new in 4.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Thanks to a list of about 750000 words and extensive
tests, wrong hyphenations have been reduced dramatically
and the number of patterns has been almost duplicated.

- Since the Spanish Academy rules of 1999 are very vague,
incomplete and even contradictory, they had to be
completed with some traditional ones. The Academy has
published new rules in November 2005 including many of
the traditional ones employed here and therefore only
minor adjustments have been necessary. 

- Patterns for a few verbal endings are necessary, and
now the "voseo" forms (used in many countries of Central
and South America) have been included.
