%% This tcx maps nothing at all.  This is useful to get back to the
%% compiled-in behavior when the formats were dumped with
%% --translate-file, which is the case for everything but (plain) "tex"
%% in TeX Live.  Thus,
%%   latex foobar                      -> terminal etc. output with 8-bit chars
%%   latex --translate-file=empty.tcx  -> terminal etc. output with ^^ notation
%%
