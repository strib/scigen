# 
# The updmap.cfg in the TEXMFDIST tree is generated by tlmgr by
# concatenating updmap-hdr.cfg with the updmap.cfg files in this tree.
#
# To make local customizations to the map files, using one of the
# following methods is simplest:
# 1) run
#       updmap-sys --enable Map=foo.map
#    for each map file.  (Or MixedMap instead of Map, if your font has
#    both Metafont and outline definitions.)  See the updmap --help
#    documentation. This will add lines to the updmap.cfg file in
#    TEXMFSYSCONFIG (creating it if necessary).
#
# 2) put all your additional fonts into TEXMFLOCAL, edit
#    TEXMFLOCAL/web2c/updmap.cfg, and run updmap-sys.
#
# See the output of updmap --help and/or
# http://tug.org/fonts/fontinstall.html for more.
# 
# In any case, manual edits to TL's updmap.cfg files, psfonts.map,
# pdftex.map, etc., will be lost on update.  So don't do that.
# 
# The default settings of the updmap options (not maps) are also
# specified in TEXMFDIST/web2c/updmap.cfg (also coming originally from
# updmap-hdr.cfg) and can be overridden by an updmap.cfg in any other
# tree.

# 
# Options for updmap.


# dvipsPreferOutline
#
# Should dvips (by default) prefer bitmap fonts or outline fonts
# if both are available? Independent of this setting, outlines
# can be forced by putting "p psfonts_t1.map" into a config file
# that dvips reads. Bitmaps (for the fonts in question) can
# be forced by putting "p psfonts_pk.map" into a config file.
# We provide such config files which can be enabled via
# dvips -Poutline ... resp. dvips -Ppk ...
#
dvipsPreferOutline true


# LW35
#
# Which fonts for the "Basic 35 Laserwriter Fonts" do you want to use and
# how are the filenames chosen? Valid settings:
#   URW:     URW fonts with "vendor" filenames (e.g. n019064l.pfb)
#   URWkb:   URW fonts with "berry" filenames (e.g. uhvbo8ac.pfb)
#   ADOBE:   Adobe fonts with "vendor" filenames (e.g. hvnbo___.pfb)
#   ADOBEkb: Adobe fonts with  "berry" filenames (e.g. phvbo8an.pfb)
#
LW35 URWkb


# dvipsDownloadBase35
# 
# Should dvips (by default) download the standard 35 LaserWriter fonts
# with the document (then set dvipsDownloadBase35 true) or should these
# fonts be used from the ps interpreter / printer?
# Whatever the default is, the user can override it by specifying
# dvips -Pdownload35 ... resp. dvips -Pbuiltin35 ... to either download
# the LW35 fonts resp. use the built-in fonts.
#
dvipsDownloadBase35 true


# pdftexDownloadBase14
#
# Should pdftex download the base 14 pdf fonts? Since some configurations
# (ps / pdf tools / printers) use bad default fonts, it is safer to download
# the fonts. The PDF files will get bigger, though.
#
pdftexDownloadBase14 true


# dvipdfmDownloadBase14
#
# Should dvipdfm(x) download the base 14 pdf fonts? Since some configurations
# (ps / pdf tools / printers) use bad default fonts, it is safer to download
# the fonts. The pdf files will get bigger, though.
#
dvipdfmDownloadBase14 true


# kanjiEmbed
#
# updmap generates a file kanjix.map for usage with dvipdfmx. With this
# option one can switch between not embedding any kanji font, or
# any of the several available. 
# 
# The value can be any string. When updmap is run, the substring
# @kanjiEmbed@ in a map file name will be replaced with this value, and
# the respective map file used.
